    Handling of native Excel charts in XLSX.jl is experimental and a work in 
    progress. All aspects may be subject to change. Feedback is welcome!


# Limitations

What chart support does not do, and why. Most of these are deliberate stopping
points rather than oversights, and each says what to do instead.

## Chart kinds with no template

A created chart starts from a chart part Excel itself wrote, kept verbatim in
the package, so the result is what Excel would have produced. That means a kind
with no template cannot be created at all, rather than being approximated:

- stacked bar and percent-stacked bar or column
- 3-D charts of any kind
- stock, surface and of-pie charts
- combo charts — a plot area with more than one group
- region maps (the `cx:` filled map), whose geography Excel resolves online

All of these are *read* normally, including their series, formatting and cached
data. The restriction is on creating them.

A combo chart is also the one case [`addSeries`](@ref) cannot extend, since
there is no single group to add the series to.

## Style and colour parts are not read

Excel keeps much of a chart's appearance in two parts beside the chart itself,
`style1.xml` and `colors1.xml`. Neither is read into the formatting cascade, so
a property written at no rung of the chart XML resolves to `nothing` — meaning
"Excel takes this from the style", not "this is off".

For a `c:` chart that is a modest gap: most of what you see is written in the
chart part. For a `cx:` chart it is a large one, because the `cx:` schema keeps
almost all appearance in the style part. Reading and writing a `cx:` chart's
data and structure works; formatting one from code reaches much less than the
equivalent `c:` call would.

The parts are preserved on write, so nothing is lost by the package not reading
them. [`FormatSite`](@ref)'s `level` already admits `:style`, so adding the rung
later would extend the cascade rather than change it.

## chartEx charts carry no cached values

Excel writes no value cache into a `cx:` chart part, so
[`getChartData`](@ref) throws for a [`ChartEx`](@ref) and a chart created with
[`addChartEx`](@ref) shows nothing until Excel opens the file and computes it.
Read the source cells instead, through [`getChartRanges`](@ref) and
[`XLSX.getdata`](@ref).

## Errors in cached data

Excel caches `#N/A` as itself and every other error value as `0`, so a
`#DIV/0!` in the source is indistinguishable from a genuine zero once the file
is written. This is a property of the format, not of the package. Where the
distinction matters, read the source cells — see
[Blanks and errors](readingCharts.md#Blanks-and-errors).

## Values are the ones Excel last wrote

Nothing is recomputed. A chart's cached values are those of the last save by
Excel, and a series added by [`addSeries`](@ref) caches the cells as they stand
at that moment. Changing a cell afterwards does not update any chart that plots
it; Excel does that when it next opens the file.

## Lines and dashes: symbols in, strings out

Dash, cap, compound and join are set with symbols (`:sysDot`, `:rnd`) and read
back as strings (`"sysDot"`, `"rnd"`), because a getter reports what the file
holds. An Excel name you set comes back as its DrawingML equivalent.

## Markers belong to some chart kinds only

A marker is a property of a line, scatter or radar series. Setting one on a bar
or pie series throws, because the schema gives `c:barSer` no `c:marker` child.
The same applies to the options [`addSeries`](@ref) takes: `smooth` is for line
and scatter series, `line` for scatter, and `color` has no meaning on a pie or
doughnut chart, whose points are coloured individually.

## Resolving text properties

[`getLabelTextProp`](@ref) resolves one run property up the cascade for a
series' data labels. There is no equivalent for a chart title, an axis title or
the legend — only the plural `…TextProps` getters, which report what one element
says. Setting is symmetrical; the gap is on the reading side.
